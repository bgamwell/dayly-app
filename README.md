#Dayly#

Dayly is an app that gets rid of the number one excuse behind not keeping a daily log or diary: time. Dayly challenges users to record their day's activities in 60 characters or fewer.

##About##

Dayly is a simple daily diary app that features a landing page, a login modal, a signup modal and a user profile (only available after login). The user profile displays a list of user-entered "diary entries" sorted in reverse chronological order. These diary entries will are limited to 60 characters, and can be edited after they're written. They each contain a time stamp.

Future iterations of the project will allow users to:
 - Visualize the frequency of their posts
 - Search diary entries
 - Share diary entries on social media
 - Schedule SMS reminders to fill in their diary (via Twilio)

All pages in the app are fully responsive and optimized for viewing on mobile devices.
